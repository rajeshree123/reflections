why you would want to create a remote repository rather then keeping the work local?
To make my work available to other people and to share my knowledge .
and to tell my thoughts if any people are working on the same concept
and if the file size is big than we can store it in cloud easily

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because in remote repository the changes will be however saved but if we wan't it in your computer you can manually pull it from the 
remote repository when ever you wan't rather than automatically backing up all the commits.
